			libTextDesc = "The UH-144 Falcon is a versatile, multipurpose utility helicopter. Unlike the nimble AV-14 Hornet or the swift AV-22 Sparrowhawk, the Falcon is exceptionally discreet, while remaining incredibly effective. The Falcon gained favor within the UNSC Army for proving to be an economical alternative to the larger Pelican dropships for short-range troop transportation and deployment. A pair of Falcons can easily and quickly transport a fully-equipped infantry squad faster than any previous helicopter, while providing overwhelming support fire, in most weather conditions. The Falcon's hull is sturdy, able to easily shrug off small arms fire and even certain heavier attacks. The frame of the Falcon is composed of a single elongated fuselage with a narrow, single-man cockpit and a large rear cabin, flanked by small wings. The pilot resides in the closed cockpit, while the crew have their choice of two gunner seats in extended buckets, two interior passenger seats, an aft bench, and a limited amount of standing room. Gunners secured themselves within the Falcon with a safety harness that hung from the ceiling.";
